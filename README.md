# Good Vs Bad Fibonacci Sequence recursive functions
My first GitHub repository. In this I go through the three ways of writing Fibonacci series generator for given n.
1. General Recursive method, this method has O (2n) time complexity.
2. Good Fibonacci series generator, this method has O (n) time complexity.
3. Dynamic Programming method, this method has O (n) time complexity with O (n) space complexity.
4. Finally I print the trace for each of these methods for given n to visualize the recursion.
